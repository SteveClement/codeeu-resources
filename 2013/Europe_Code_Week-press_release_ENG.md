# Europe Code Week: a week to celebrate coding all over Europe

October 16, All over Europe - Computer programming is being heralded as the new literacy, yet it is still widely perceived as a skill that can only mastered with a computer science degree. With the wider availability of internet connectivity and freely available, easy to use technologies, this is no longer the case. To encourage more people to create our digital future, Europe Code Week is looking for events to celebrate coding between November 25 - 30, 2013.

Coding is not just about building the next big mobile app. Computer programming is a fun, creative way of making ideas happen. Being able to talk to computers and understanding modern technology is becoming a competitive advantage. Which is why Europe Code Week is looking for events and initiatives that will encourage all Europeans, regardless of age, gender and profession, to learn more about the art and science of coding in the last week of November. 

Despite the increasing importance of the digital sector, there is a projected shortfall of up to 900,000 ICT professionals in Europe by 2015. Technology startups, a future pillar of European economy, are already facing a talent shortage, which is limiting their growth potential. In that context, it is worrying that most of our youngest Europeans still don't have access to coding classes that teach creative thinking, provide tools for creation and encourage them to start dreaming of the next big Facebook or Google. It is vital to engage children at an early age, introduce computer programming as interesting, relevant and accessible, and use the free connectivity offered by schools.  

The good news is that Europe is the home of successful global initiatives like [CoderDojo](http://coderdojo.com/), [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/) and many more that haven't yet received the recognition they deserve. Many volunteer hours have already been invested in providing free, hands-on workshops and events for youth, women, and other groups that are still underrepresented in the world of technology. Initiatives like these need to be celebrated and promoted across Europe on a bigger scale to attract new partners that can encourage more citizens to use technology in creative ways.

Europe Code Week welcomes any activities that aim to promote coding, highlight its history and the diversity of the applications. Primarily, Code Week is looking for participation in the form of events, ranging from programming workshops to company visits to lectures. The end goal is to improve the visibility of coding on a European scale, motivate people to start learning to code, and connect individuals, groups, organizations, and companies who are willing to share good practices and help more people experience the joy and relevance of coding.

Europe Code Week was launched by Neelie Kroes' Young Advisors with the support from DG Connect at the European Commission. The Young Advisors will be working closely with their national Digital Champions as local ambassadors in different European countries. Ultimately, Europe Code Week is an open source project, so anyone is welcome to join and contribute either as ambassador or by providing content and technical skills. Existing initiatives are welcome to add themselves to the European Coding map on the Europe Code Week website, where Europe Code Week events will also be highlighted: http://codeweek.eu
